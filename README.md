📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales, inventory, and supply chain performance using SQL.
The dataset includes product details, sales transactions, inventory levels, demand forecasts, discounts, competitor pricing, weather conditions, and seasonality.

The goal is to derive actionable insights for decision-making in:

Inventory management (overstock, stockouts, risk analysis)

Sales performance benchmarking (top products, store efficiency, revenue trends)

Demand forecasting & accuracy measurement

Impact of external factors (weather, discounts, seasonality, holidays)

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following key fields:

Product Details: Product_ID, Category, Region, Store_ID

Inventory & Sales: Inventory_Level, Units_Sold, Units_Ordered, Demand_Forecast

Pricing: Price, Discount, Competitor_Pricing

External Factors: Weather_Condition, Holiday/Promotion, Seasonality

Performance Metrics: Revenue, Forecast_Accuracy, Forecast_Error

🔍 Key SQL Queries / Analyses

Overstock & Stockout Analysis – Identify overstocked items and frequent stockouts.

Sales Performance – Revenue & units sold by category, region, and store.

Best & Worst Products – Top sellers, underperforming products, forecast accuracy rankings.

Demand Forecasting – Forecast error %, moving averages, monthly forecast vs. actuals.

External Factors – Impact of discounts, weather, holidays, and seasonality on sales.

Store & Supply Chain Efficiency – Revenue per inventory, store performance ranking.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite — mention what you used)

Dataset: Retail inventory & sales records (sample dataset)

Optional: Excel / Tableau / Power BI for visualization (if you added dashboards)

📈 Insights & Findings

Identified products at risk of stockouts due to low inventory vs. high forecast.

Found overstock patterns where inventory levels were >2× units sold.

Discounts between 10–15% correlated with higher sales, while deeper discounts showed diminishing returns.

Weather and holidays significantly boosted sales in groceries & toys categories.

Clothing category had the highest forecast accuracy, while electronics showed larger forecast errors.
